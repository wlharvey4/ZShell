* From Bash to Z Shell

    There are several major shells. Because each has its differences,
    covering all of the shells could make a book that’s both confusing
    and unwieldy. We’ve concentrated on bash and zsh, two of the most
    modern and powerful shells. Both are freely available; in fact,
    they’re installed on many of the systems we’ve listed and can be
    downloaded from the Internet for the rest.

    - ~bash~ is the de facto standard shell on Linux.  ~bash~ runs
      most scripts written for other Bourne-type shells, including the
      original Unix shell ~sh~.

    - ~zsh~, also called Z shell, is an extremely powerful shell
      that’s not as well known as ~bash~.  ~zsh~ combines most of the
      best features of several shells, including C-type shells such as
      ~tcsh~.  However, its basic usage is similar to ~bash~.


    This book provides the first comprehensive Z shell coverage that
    we know of.  Covering both ~bash~ and ~zsh` shows you what
    features the two shells have in common as well as their different
    approaches to the same tasks.
